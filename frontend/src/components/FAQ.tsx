      question: "What is $FIND?",
      answer:
        "$FIND is a Solana-based token that powers the Criminal Case IRL Finds game. Holders compete to find real-life items during live submission windows for SOL rewards.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does the game work?",
      answer:
        "Every 25 minutes, a new round begins with a target item announced. The highest $FIND holder gets a 3-minute window to find and submit a photo of the item. If verified, they win SOL rewards!",
    },
    {
      question: "How are rewards calculated?",
      answer:
        "Rewards are based on trading volume: Base reward (0.01 SOL) + Volume bonus (0.5% of 24h volume). Minimum reward is 0.01 SOL, maximum is 1 SOL per round.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I become the highest holder?",
      answer:
        "Buy and hold more $FIND tokens than anyone else. The system automatically tracks holder balances and ranks them in real-time. The highest holder at the start of each round gets the submission opportunity.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I'm not the highest holder?",
      answer:
        "You can still participate by watching the live feed, checking the leaderboard, and waiting for your chance to become the top holder. The rankings update constantly based on token holdings.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I submit a photo?",
      answer:
        "When you're the highest holder during a submission window, a photo submission form will automatically appear. Drag & drop or click to upload your find, then submit with your wallet signature.",
    },
    {
      question: "How are submissions verified?",
      answer:
        "All submissions are reviewed by our admin team. Photos must clearly show the target item and be submitted within the 3-minute window. Invalid submissions are rejected.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if I miss the submission window?",
      answer:
        "If you miss the 3-minute window, the opportunity passes to the next round. Make sure you're ready when the submission window opens!",
    },
    {
      question: "How often do rounds happen?",
      answer:
        "New rounds start every 25 minutes. Each round has a 22-minute active period followed by a 3-minute submission window for the highest holder.",
    },
    {
      question: "Where can I buy $FIND tokens?",
      answer:
        "Check our social media channels for the latest information on where to purchase $FIND tokens. Make sure to verify you're buying the correct token contract address.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is this safe?",
      answer:
        "Yes! All transactions are secured by Solana blockchain technology. We use wallet signatures for authentication and never ask for your private keys. Always verify the contract address before trading.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if I have technical issues?",
      answer:
        "Check our troubleshooting guide, ensure your wallet is connected, and verify you have the latest version of your wallet extension. For additional support, reach out through our social channels.",
